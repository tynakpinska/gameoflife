## What is the Game of Life?

The goal of this app is to help you achieve success by motivating you to do something small, that closes you to fulfilling your dreams, each day. It was inspired by [Zen Jaskiniowca](https://zenjaskiniowca.pl/jak-wyrobic-nawyk-wygrywania/) podcast, that really helped me see how important everyday activities are and how powerful doing little tasks can make you feel. After some time you'll build a habit of winning and you'll start to feel extremely effective.

First, decide what do you want your life to be like in three main areas (according to [Rafa≈Ç Mazur](https://zenjaskiniowca.pl/o-mnie/)):
1. body shape
2. state of mind
3. bank balance

Second, every morning think of three to five todos that will significantly close you to your dreams defined in the previous step. Add tasks to your power list by clicking Enter.

Finally, start the game and smash every todo! The app shows how much time till the end of the day you have left. Consider it a game. If you do all the challenges - you won the game. If you don't - you lost.

Additionaly, after a busy day, see your streak. Admire how hard you worked and see how far it got you. Try it out and see it for yourself!
